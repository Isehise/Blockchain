The company provides an array of services and products that utilize blockchain technology. The company applies cutting edge cryptography and security engineering which aims at making financial markets less reliant on trust. This is achieved by strengthening the Bitcoin ecosystem.  
Bloclstream provides an open-ended source platform called Element which allows for deploying sidechains and blockchains that are created on a blockchain network to be accessible by users.

##Why This Matters

This is a significant development because this feature allows for developers to have access to other blockchain issued assets. An element blockchain can act as a standalone blockchain or be attached to another blockchain as a sidechain to enable verifying assets transferred between two or more blockchains. Element allows for multiple assets to be issued and transactions are blinded using confidential transactions.

##Why This May be Interesting

Blockstream is already a large provider of the bitcoin blockchain ecosystem as there a larger crypto platform that adopt most of its technologies and features. This company is paving the way for the crypto currency landscape in creating platforms, tools and technologies that continue to eliminate third party trust, improve decentralization and enhance security of the blockchain network.
